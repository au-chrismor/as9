AS9 - Motorola 6809 Assembler

I am a newcomer to the 6809 Processor (40 years, be hey, who's counting?), and I am given to understand this is the original Motorola Assembler which was originally written for use with MS-DOS.

The changes to the code are simply function declarations to allow a modern compiler to build the package.  It compiles under MacOS, FreeBSD and CentOS Linux.  It should also compile under Windows with changes to the Makefile.

I am not taking any credit for this at all, just trying to make it easier for folks like me to find.  It was through reading https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/m6809.html that I found this in the first place.
